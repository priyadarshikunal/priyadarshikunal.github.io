                  As part of the People Experience Technology team, I worked on
                  Amazon's Compensation Platform. The new system enabled
                  Amazon's million+ workforce to view and understand their
                  compensation structure and changes over their tenure. <br />
                  The challenge was to create a highly interactive infographic
                  system with complex custom components written from scratch,
                  meeting our high standards of accessibility and
                  internationalization.

                <li>
                  As part of the Alexa team, I developed the backend system that
                  sent security hunch notifications to customer's Amazon Echo
                  devices when they would leave their homes.<br />
                  The challenge was to deliver these notifications at very low
                  latency and meet the high security&sol;privacy bar of Alexa.

                <li>
                  As part of the AWS Identity Console team, I migrated the

                  simplifying our new feature development.

                  I managed a team of Software Developers in the Alexa team and
                  Amazon Fulfillment Center teams.<br />
                  I was responsible for defining our technical roadmap delivery
                  products on time and within budget.<br />
                  As a people manager, I made hiring, appraisal, and firing
                  decisions. I mentored engineers at different levels working
                  across tech stacks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As part of the Alexa Sensitive Content Intelligence team, I
                  developed the service to detect and mitigate sensitive content
                  in customer utterances and Alexa responses to handle the use
                  cases in a customer-friendly manner.<br />
                  The challenge was to perform the detection and mitigation at
                  ~3ms latency while performing a large set of checks on tens of
                  thousands of transactions per second.<br />
                  I designed and developed the application to manage the
                  sensitivity rules, which could manage complex boolean rules
                  and business use cases while being user-friendly for our
                  customer support associates.<br />
                  It helped us update the rules in real-time, which would
                  previously take a week.<br />
                  Without a dedicated design team, I doubled up as a UX designer
                  on the project and performed end-to-end product releases.

                <li>
                  I developed a Flask service to host ML models for detecting
                  sensitivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Implemented CI&sol;CD for these services for easy and timely
                  delivery of product features and issue resolution to
                  customers.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I developed applications to help the team manage
                  domain-specific data and ML model training workflows.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I developed the Subscribe & Save feature on Amazon's retail
                  website. I also created the accompanying Manage Your
                  Deliveries dashboard for customers to manage their
                  subscriptions.<br />
                  One challenge here was adding a complex feature to critical
                  Amazon pages without impacting the latency and asset bundle
                  sizes.<br />
                  Added feature flags for these new features and performed a
                  data-driven evaluation for the launch success criteria.

                  Another focus area for the frameworks was to create use friendly test reports and add documentation for framework consumers.
